**Key Components:**
- **Message Endpoint:**  
  • Endpoint: `POST /agents/{agentId}/run`  
  • Payload Format (JSON):  
    ```json
    {
      "senderId": "string",
      "receiverId": "string",
      "timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp",
      "messageType": "intent_query | data_response | error_notification",
      "payload": { ... },
      "sessionContext": {
          "sessionId": "string",
          "priorMessages": [ "string", "..." ]
      }
    }
    ```
- **Message Parsing and Dispatching:**  
  • Implement logic that parses incoming JSON messages and routes commands to the appropriate execution module.
- **Response Mechanism:**  
  • Construct a consistent response format (e.g., `{ status, message, data }`) and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

**Enhancements:**
- Allow for both RESTful and real-time (WebSocket) options to facilitate event-driven communication.
- Standardize the message schema and document it thoroughly for future automated interactions.

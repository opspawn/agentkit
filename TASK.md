# TASK.md

## Overview
This TASK.md document provides a detailed, step-by-step checklist for developing the Python module of AgentKit. It is designed to guide the development team through each phase—from initialization and core module development to integration, testing, and final documentation.

---

## Phases and Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Initialization & Research
- [x] **Task 1.1:** Set up Git repository and branch structure for the Python module.
  - *Dependency:* Ensure access to the Opspawn repository.
- [x] **Task 1.2:** Configure the local development environment.
  - *Steps:* Install Python 3.9+, set up virtual environments, and configure IDE settings.
- [x] **Task 1.3:** Create initial Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration specific to the Python module.
- [x] **Task 1.4:** Audit the AgentKit Development document to extract Python-specific requirements.
  - *Reference:* AgentkitDevelopmentDoc.md citeturn1file0.
- [x] **Task 1.5:** Document the Python-focused technology stack and confirm tool selections (Flask/FastAPI, pytest, Docker, GitHub Actions).

### Phase 2: Core Module Development & Refactoring

#### Agent Registration Module
- [x] **Task 2.1:** Design and implement the registration API endpoint (`POST /agents/register`) using Flask/FastAPI.
  - *Description:* Develop endpoint logic, ensuring proper JSON input and unique Agent ID generation.
- [x] **Task 2.2:** Implement JSON schema validation for agent registration payloads.
- [x] **Task 2.3:** Integrate an in-memory storage solution (e.g., Python dictionary or Redis) for storing agent metadata.

#### Messaging Interface Module
- [x] **Task 2.4:** Develop the messaging endpoint (`POST /agents/{agentId}/run`) to handle agent messages.
- [x] **Task 2.5:** Implement parsing and dispatching of incoming messages, and standardize the response format.
- [x] **Task 2.6:** Integrate error handling to manage invalid or malformed message payloads.

#### Tool Integration Module
- [x] **Task 2.7:** Create a generic Python interface (abstract base class) for tool integration.
  - *Description:* Define required methods (authentication, parameter mapping) and implement a sample tool connector.
- [x] **Task 2.8:** Document the tool registration process and interface conventions.

---

### Phase 3: Integration & Interface Development

- [x] **Task 3.1:** Develop a Python SDK to encapsulate core API calls:
  - *Subtask:* Implement helper functions for agent registration, message dispatching, and tool invocation.
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Create a simple CLI application for testing API endpoints.
  - *Commands:* Support commands for registration, messaging, and triggering tool integrations.
- [x] **Task 3.3:** Ensure seamless integration between Flask/FastAPI endpoints and the Python SDK.
- [x] **Task 3.4:** Implement middleware for structured logging and error handling across all endpoints.
  - *Reference:* Follow the communication and logging best practices from the AgentKit document.

---

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation

- [x] **Task 4.1:** Write unit tests for all modules using pytest.
  - *Subtasks:*
    - Test agent registration with valid and invalid payloads.
    - Test messaging endpoint parsing and response formats.
    - Test the tool integration interface.
- [x] **Task 4.2:** Develop integration tests that simulate full workflows (registration → messaging → tool invocation).
- [ ] **Task 4.4:** Perform basic load and performance testing on the API endpoints.
- [ ] **Task 4.5:** Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with sample use cases from the internal team.

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization

- [ ] **Task 5.1:** Update the Developer README with installation, configuration, and usage instructions specific to the Python module.
- [ ] **Task 5.2:** Generate API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.
- [ ] **Task 5.3:** Create sample projects and comprehensive tutorials showcasing the Python SDK and CLI usage.
- [ ] **Task 5.4:** Document configuration details, environment variables, and any external dependencies.
- [ ] **Task 5.5:** Final review and consolidation of all project documentation for final integration.

---

## Backlog / Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Task B1:** Implement asynchronous messaging support.
- [ ] **Task B2:** Integrate persistent storage options by migrating from in-memory storage to a dedicated database.
- [ ] **Task B3:** Develop additional debugging tools and a web-based log inspection dashboard.
- [ ] **Task B4:** Expand the Python SDK to support multi-language integrations and additional tool connectors.
- [ ] **Task B5:** Optimize API performance and refine security validations based on production feedback.

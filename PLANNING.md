# PLANNING.md

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name and Description
- **Project Name:** AgentKit Python Module for Opspawn  
- **Description:** This module is a core component of the Opspawn AgentKit that enables rapid prototyping and the building of autonomous AI agents using Python. It encompasses key functionalities such as agent registration, messaging, and tool integration, with an emphasis on local-first development and straightforward scalability to cloud environments. This initial focus on the Python aspects lays the foundation for future multi-language integration and further enhancements citeturn1file0.

### Objective
- **Primary Goal:** Develop a comprehensive, secure, and scalable Python module that allows developers to register agents, handle inter-agent messaging, and integrate external tools seamlessly.
- **Long-Term Vision:** Integrate the Python module into the broader Opspawn ecosystem, eventually offering a robust Python SDK along with full RESTful API support and enhanced developer tooling.

## 2. Vision & Objectives

### Vision Statement
- **Vision:** To empower developers with a developer‑friendly, Python‑based framework for building, deploying, and managing autonomous AI agents. This module is designed to be robust, extensible, and easy to integrate with other Opspawn components.

### Key Objectives
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Enable quick iteration and testing of AI agents using Python.
- **Standardized Communication:** Implement RESTful API endpoints using consistent JSON schemas for agent registration, messaging, and tool integration.
- **Extensibility:** Design the system to be modular, allowing future integration of asynchronous messaging, persistent storage, and additional language SDKs.
- **Developer-Friendliness:** Provide clear documentation, sample projects, and a CLI for testing that lowers the barrier to entry for developers.

## 3. Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **Agent Registration Module:**  
  Handles the validation and registration of agents, generating unique IDs and storing metadata (e.g., capabilities, configurations) using an in‑memory structure or Redis.
- **Messaging Interface Module:**  
  Provides endpoints to send and receive structured messages (including synchronous and asynchronous options) between agents.
- **Tool Integration Module:**  
  Offers a generic interface for invoking internal or external tools, supporting tasks such as parameter mapping and unified response formats.
- **Python SDK:**  
  Wraps the core API calls, offering helper functions for registration, messaging, and tool integration with a focus on clear type definitions and ease of use.
- **API Endpoints:**  
  Developed using Flask or FastAPI, these RESTful endpoints expose the functionalities of the above modules.

### Deliverable Documents
- **Architecture Analysis Document:** Detailed diagrams (UML, sequence, data flow) to explain module interactions.
- **Adaptation Plan:** A guideline for scaling the local-first Python module for deployment in cloud environments.

### Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Web Framework:** Flask or FastAPI for building RESTful APIs.
- **Testing Tools:** pytest for unit and integration tests.
- **Containerization:** Docker (with Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration).
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions to automate testing and linting.
- **Data Format:** JSON (with well-defined, standardized schemas).

### Constraints & Considerations
- **Local-First Development:** The module should work efficiently on local machines to facilitate early development and testing.
- **Security:** Emphasize secure API design and comprehensive input validation to protect against injection attacks.
- **Interoperability:** Adhere strictly to standardized JSON schemas and RESTful API design to allow easy future integration with other components.
- **Non-goals:** Avoid over-engineering advanced cloud orchestration or persistent storage mechanisms until the core Python functionality is stable and tested.

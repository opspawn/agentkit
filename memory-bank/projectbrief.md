# Project Brief: AgentKit Python Module for Opspawn

## 1. Project Name and Description

- **Project Name:** AgentKit Python Module for Opspawn
- **Description:** This module is a core component of the Opspawn AgentKit designed to enable rapid prototyping and the building of autonomous AI agents using Python. It focuses on key functionalities like agent registration, messaging, and tool integration, emphasizing local-first development with a clear path to cloud scalability. This Python module forms the foundation for future multi-language support within the AgentKit ecosystem.

## 2. Core Purpose & Objectives

- **Purpose:** AgentKit serves as the core toolkit for rapidly prototyping and building autonomous AI agents within the Opspawn ecosystem. It provides modular, language-agnostic components (initially focusing on Python) to facilitate the creation of task-specific agents.
- **Primary Goal:** Develop a comprehensive, secure, and scalable Python module allowing developers to register agents, handle inter-agent messaging (synchronous and asynchronous), and integrate external tools seamlessly via standardized interfaces and protocols.
- **Long-Term Vision:** Integrate the Python module into the broader Opspawn ecosystem, eventually offering a robust Python SDK, full RESTful API support, enhanced developer tooling, and support for multiple languages (including TypeScript).

## 3. Key Objectives

- **Rapid Prototyping:** Enable quick iteration and testing of AI agents using Python.
- **Standardized Communication:** Implement consistent protocols and schemas (RESTful APIs, JSON) for agent registration, messaging, and tool integration to ensure interoperability and ease future integration.
- **Extensibility & Modularity:** Design the system with independent modules (Registration, Messaging, Tool Integration) to allow for future enhancements like persistent storage, advanced messaging, and additional language SDKs.
- **Developer-Friendliness:** Provide clear documentation, sample projects, SDKs (Python initially), and potentially a CLI/UI to lower the barrier to entry for developers.
- **Local-First Development:** Ensure the module works efficiently on local machines for easy development and testing, with a defined path for cloud deployment.

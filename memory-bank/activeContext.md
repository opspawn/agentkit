# Active Context: AgentKit Python Module (Post-Task 4.4)

## 1. Current Work Focus

-   **Phase 4: Testing & Validation:** Continuing work on ensuring quality and robustness.
-   **Task 4.4 Complete:** Performed basic load testing.
-   **Task 4.5: User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** The immediate focus is now on conducting UAT via example use cases.

## 2. Recent Changes

-   **Task 4.1 Complete:** Enhanced unit test coverage using `pytest-cov`, achieving >90% overall coverage. Added tests for CLI module.
-   **Task 4.2 Complete:** Developed integration tests (`tests/integration/test_workflows.py`) covering key workflows (registration, messaging, external tool invocation).
    -   Created a mock external tool service (`tests/mock_services/mock_tool.py`).
    -   Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include the mock service.
    -   Refactored tool registry and messaging endpoint to support external HTTP tools.
    -   Registered mock tool in `main.py`.
-   **Tracking Update:** Updated `TASK.md` to mark tasks 4.1 and 4.2 as complete.
-   **Documentation:** Updated `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` with the integration test plan.
-   **Task 4.3 Removed:** CI/CD refinement task (formerly 4.3) was removed from the plan.
-   **Task 4.4 Complete:** Added `locust` dependency, created `locustfile.py`, ran basic load test (10 users, 60s) against registration and messaging endpoints via Docker Compose. Identified and fixed payload issue (`name` vs `agentName`). Test showed good performance and expected `409 Conflict` errors for duplicate registrations.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

-   **Plan UAT:** Define 1-2 simple example agent scenarios (e.g., echo agent, basic tool user agent) to be implemented in the `examples/` directory.
-   **Implement Examples:** Create the example agent scripts using the Python SDK.
-   **Test Examples:** Run the examples locally (potentially using Docker Compose) to verify core functionality from an end-user perspective.
-   **Document UAT:** Briefly document the scenarios tested and results.
-   **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the completion of Task 4.4.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

-   **UAT Scope:** Define the complexity of the example agents needed for adequate UAT coverage for this phase.
-   **Example Structure:** Decide on a consistent structure for example agent scripts.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

-   **Automation:** Emphasize automating checks in CI to maintain code quality.
-   **Testing:** Continue ensuring both unit and integration tests are run reliably.
-   **Documentation:** Keep Memory Bank updated.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

-   Refactoring the tool registry to support external tools was necessary for realistic integration testing.
-   Integration tests successfully validated the interaction between the API, SDK, and external (mock) services.
-   Basic load testing (Task 4.4) revealed a payload mismatch (`name` vs `agentName`) in the initial `locustfile.py`, highlighting the importance of aligning test scripts with API models.
-   The API handled duplicate registration attempts correctly with `409 Conflict` errors under light load.
-   Focus shifts to User Acceptance Testing (Task 4.5) using practical examples.

# Active Context: AgentKit Python Module (Post-Task B8)

## 1. Current Work Focus

-   **Backlog Tasks:** Completed B7 (Ops-Core Readiness) and B8 (LLM Assistance Docs).
-   **Current State:** AgentKit core functionality is stable. Preparatory work for Ops-Core integration is complete from AgentKit's side. Documentation updated.

## 2. Recent Changes

-   **Task B7 Complete (Ops-Core Readiness):**
    -   Refactored SDK client (`agentkit/sdk/client.py`) to use `httpx` and be asynchronous.
    -   Added `report_state_to_opscore` method to SDK for agents to report status directly to Ops-Core.
    -   Updated configuration (`docs/configuration.md`, `.env.example`) to include `OPSCORE_API_URL` and `OPSCORE_API_KEY`.
    -   Added example agent `examples/opscore_aware_agent.py`.
    -   Added `pytest-httpx` dependency.
    -   Updated SDK unit tests (`tests/sdk/test_client.py`) for async and added tests for `report_state_to_opscore`.
    -   Added integration tests (`tests/integration/test_opscore_integration.py`) using `pytest-httpserver` to mock Ops-Core.
    -   Updated `docs/TUTORIAL.md` and `README.md` to mention Ops-Core integration capability.
    -   Updated `TASK.md`.
-   **Task B8 Complete (LLM Assistance Docs):**
    -   Created `docs/building_agents_with_llms.md` guide for developers using LLMs to build AgentKit agents.
    -   Created `docs/agentkit_llm_context.txt` comprehensive context bundle for pasting into LLMs, focusing on standalone AgentKit development first.
    -   Refined both documents based on feedback to clarify focus and include setup instructions.
    -   Updated `TASK.md`.
-   **Integration Docs Created:**
    -   Created `docs/opscore_integration.md` (guide for AgentKit developers).
    -   Created `docs/agentkit_integration_for_opscore.md` (technical guide for Ops-Core developers).

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

-   **Finalize AgentKit Session:** Perform Git operations (add, commit, push) for all changes made in this session.
-   **Identify Next Focus:** Based on user direction, the next focus will likely shift to Ops-Core development.
-   **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the completion of Tasks B7 and B8.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

-   Decision made to complete AgentKit preparations (Task B7) and associated documentation (Task B8, integration guides) before shifting focus to Ops-Core development.
-   LLM assistance documentation focuses on standalone AgentKit usage first, positioning Ops-Core integration as an optional, subsequent step.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

-   Continued emphasis on clear documentation for different audiences (developers using AgentKit, developers integrating with AgentKit, LLM assistants).
-   Importance of providing comprehensive context bundles (`.txt` file) for effective LLM assistance.
-   Testing integration points using mock servers (`pytest-httpserver`, `pytest-httpx`).

## 6. Learnings & Insights

-   Refactoring synchronous code (SDK client) to asynchronous requires careful updates to tests and usage patterns.
-   Creating documentation specifically for LLM assistants requires a different approach than human-focused docs, including explicit guidance and context bundling.
-   Clarifying the primary focus (standalone AgentKit vs. Ops-Core integration) is important for documentation clarity.

# Active Context: AgentKit Python Module (Post-Task 4.2)

## 1. Current Work Focus

-   **Phase 4: Testing & Validation:** Continuing work on ensuring quality and robustness.
-   **Task 4.4: Basic Load Testing:** The immediate focus is now on performing basic load testing on key API endpoints.

## 2. Recent Changes

-   **Task 4.1 Complete:** Enhanced unit test coverage using `pytest-cov`, achieving >90% overall coverage. Added tests for CLI module.
-   **Task 4.2 Complete:** Developed integration tests (`tests/integration/test_workflows.py`) covering key workflows (registration, messaging, external tool invocation).
    -   Created a mock external tool service (`tests/mock_services/mock_tool.py`).
    -   Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include the mock service.
    -   Refactored tool registry and messaging endpoint to support external HTTP tools.
    -   Registered mock tool in `main.py`.
-   **Tracking Update:** Updated `TASK.md` to mark tasks 4.1 and 4.2 as complete.
-   **Documentation:** Updated `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` with the integration test plan.
-   **Task 4.3 Removed:** CI/CD refinement task (formerly 4.3) has been removed from the current plan.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

-   **Plan Load Testing:** Define key API endpoints (e.g., registration, messaging) and scenarios for load testing using a tool like `locust`.
-   **Implement Load Tests:** Write basic `locustfile.py`.
-   **Execute Load Tests:** Run `locust` locally against the service (potentially via Docker Compose).
-   **Analyze Results:** Document basic findings (requests/sec, failure rates).
-   **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the removal of Task 4.3 and focus on 4.4.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

-   **Load Testing Scope:** Determine the target load (users, requests/sec) and duration for initial tests.
-   **Load Testing Environment:** Confirm running load tests against the local Docker Compose setup is sufficient for this task.
-   **Load Testing Tool:** Confirm `locust` is the appropriate tool.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

-   **Automation:** Emphasize automating checks in CI to maintain code quality.
-   **Testing:** Continue ensuring both unit and integration tests are run reliably.
-   **Documentation:** Keep Memory Bank updated.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

-   Refactoring the tool registry to support external tools was necessary for realistic integration testing.
-   Integration tests successfully validated the interaction between the API, SDK, and external (mock) services.
-   Decision made to defer CI/CD refinement (formerly Task 4.3). Focus shifts to load testing (Task 4.4).

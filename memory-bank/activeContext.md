# Active Context: AgentKit Python Module (Initialization)

## 1. Current Work Focus

-   **Establishing Project Foundation:** The immediate focus is on setting up the core project structure, development environment, and essential documentation, including the Memory Bank itself.
-   **Memory Bank Creation:** Populating the initial Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on existing planning documents (`PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, `AgentkitDevelopmentDoc.md`).
-   **Phase 1 Tasks:** Preparing to begin the tasks outlined in Phase 1 of `TASK.md`, specifically:
    -   Task 1.1: Git repository setup.
    -   Task 1.2: Local development environment configuration (Python 3.9+, venv).
    -   Task 1.3: Initial Dockerfile/Docker Compose setup.
    -   Task 1.4: Formal audit of `AgentkitDevelopmentDoc.md` for Python requirements (partially covered by Memory Bank creation).
    -   Task 1.5: Finalizing and documenting the tech stack choices (e.g., Flask vs. FastAPI).

## 2. Recent Changes

-   Initial creation of the Memory Bank directory and core files.
-   Synthesis of project information from `PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, and `AgentkitDevelopmentDoc.md` into the Memory Bank.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

-   Complete the creation of the initial Memory Bank (`progress.md`).
-   Proceed with Task 1.1 (Git setup) and Task 1.2 (Local environment setup) from `TASK.md`.
-   Make a definitive choice between Flask and FastAPI for the API framework.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

-   **Flask vs. FastAPI:** A decision needs to be made soon. FastAPI offers built-in data validation (Pydantic) and automatic API docs (Swagger), which aligns well with the project's emphasis on standardization and developer experience. Flask is simpler for basic cases but requires more manual setup for validation and docs. *Leaning towards FastAPI.*
-   **Storage:** Confirming the use of a simple in-memory Python dictionary for initial agent/tool storage before potentially introducing Redis.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

-   **Documentation First:** Establishing the Memory Bank before significant code implementation reinforces the importance of documentation.
-   **Modularity:** Adhering to the modular design outlined in `systemPatterns.md` from the start.
-   **Standardization:** Emphasizing the use of defined JSON schemas and REST principles for all API interactions.
-   **Testing:** Keeping in mind the requirement to add `pytest` tests for all new functionality (as per `project-guidelines.md` and `TASK.md`).

## 6. Learnings & Insights

-   The existing planning documents provide a solid foundation, but synthesizing them into the Memory Bank structure helps clarify relationships and priorities.
-   The need for a decision on Flask/FastAPI is an early critical path item for Phase 2 development.

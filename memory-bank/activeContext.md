# Active Context: AgentKit Python Module (Post-Task 4.2)

## 1. Current Work Focus

-   **Phase 4: Testing & Validation:** Continuing work on ensuring quality and robustness.
-   **Task 4.3: Refine CI/CD:** The immediate focus is now on refining the GitHub Actions workflow to include comprehensive testing (unit and integration), coverage reporting, linting, and formatting checks.

## 2. Recent Changes

-   **Task 4.1 Complete:** Enhanced unit test coverage using `pytest-cov`, achieving >90% overall coverage. Added tests for CLI module.
-   **Task 4.2 Complete:** Developed integration tests (`tests/integration/test_workflows.py`) covering key workflows (registration, messaging, external tool invocation).
    -   Created a mock external tool service (`tests/mock_services/mock_tool.py`).
    -   Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include the mock service.
    -   Refactored tool registry and messaging endpoint to support external HTTP tools.
    -   Registered mock tool in `main.py`.
-   **Tracking Update:** Updated `TASK.md` to mark tasks 4.1 and 4.2 as complete.
-   **Documentation:** Updated `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` with the integration test plan.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

-   **Analyze Existing CI:** Review the current GitHub Actions workflow file (likely in `.github/workflows/`).
-   **Plan CI Enhancements:** Determine the necessary changes to:
    -   Run both unit and integration tests (potentially requiring Docker setup within CI).
    -   Generate and potentially upload/check coverage reports (`pytest-cov`).
    -   Ensure linting (`flake8`) and formatting (`black --check`) steps are present and effective.
-   **Implement CI Changes:** Modify the workflow YAML file.
-   **Update `progress.md`:** Reflect the completion of Tasks 4.1 and 4.2.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

-   **CI Environment:** Decide how to handle the Docker dependency for integration tests within the GitHub Actions runner (e.g., using Docker-in-Docker, specific actions, or service containers).
-   **Coverage Reporting:** Determine if coverage results should just be logged, uploaded as artifacts, or integrated with services like Codecov.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

-   **Automation:** Emphasize automating checks in CI to maintain code quality.
-   **Testing:** Continue ensuring both unit and integration tests are run reliably.
-   **Documentation:** Keep Memory Bank updated.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

-   Refactoring the tool registry to support external tools was necessary for realistic integration testing.
-   Integration tests successfully validated the interaction between the API, SDK, and external (mock) services.
-   A robust CI pipeline is the next critical step to ensure ongoing quality.

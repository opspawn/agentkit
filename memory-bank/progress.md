# Progress: AgentKit Python Module (Post-Task 5.2, Pre-Task 5.3 Impl)

## 1. What Works / Completed

-   **Phase 1: Initialization & Research:** (Complete)
-   **Phase 2: Core Module Development & Refactoring:** (Complete)
-   **Phase 3: Integration & Interface Development:** (Complete)
-   **Phase 4: Testing & Validation:** (Complete)
    -   Task 4.1: Unit Tests Enhanced (>90% coverage).
    -   Task 4.2: Integration Tests Developed.
    -   Task 4.4: Basic Load Testing Performed.
    -   Task 4.5: User Acceptance Testing via examples completed.
-   **Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization (Partial):**
    -   **Task 5.1:** Developer README (`README.md`) updated.
    -   **Task 5.2:** Auto-generated API documentation reviewed and confirmed accurate.
    -   **Task 5.3:** Planning and research completed. Decided to implement a generic LLM tool using `litellm`.
-   **Documentation:** Planning docs, `TASK.md`, `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, `UAT_PLAN_TASK_4_5.md`, `README.md`, and Memory Bank updated.

## 2. What's Left to Build (High-Level Phases from TASK.md)

-   **Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization:** **(Current Focus)**
    -   Task 5.3: Implement generic LLM tool using `litellm`, create example, update docs/tutorial. **(Next)**
    -   Task 5.4: Document configuration details.
    -   Task 5.5: Final review and consolidation.
-   **Backlog / Future Enhancements:** All tasks pending.

## 3. Current Status

-   **Overall:** Phases 1-4 complete. Phase 5 is in progress (Tasks 5.1, 5.2 complete; 5.3 planned).
-   **Code:** Core API, SDK, CLI implemented and tested. Example scripts exist. Planning for generic LLM tool complete.
-   **Infrastructure:** Docker setup includes API and mock tool service. Basic CI workflow exists.
-   **Documentation:** Memory Bank updated. `README.md` updated. API docs confirmed. Plan for Task 5.3 established. `TUTORIAL.md` still needs creation.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   Implementation of Task 5.3 requires user to provide LLM API key in a `.env` file.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

-   Completed Phases 1-4.
-   Completed Tasks 5.1 and 5.2.
-   Researched LLM abstraction libraries (`litellm`, `pydantic-ai`).
-   Decided to use `litellm` to build a generic, model-agnostic LLM tool connector as part of Task 5.3, rather than simpler examples or provider-specific implementations. This requires user configuration via `.env`.
-   Transitioned focus to implementing Task 5.3 (Generic LLM Tool).

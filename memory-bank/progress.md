# Progress: AgentKit Python Module (Post-Task 4.2)

## 1. What Works / Completed

-   **Phase 1: Initialization & Research:**
    -   Git repository and local environment setup.
    -   Initial Docker configuration.
    -   Technology stack finalized (Python 3.9+, FastAPI, Pydantic, Pytest).
-   **Phase 2: Core Module Development & Refactoring:**
    -   Agent Registration Module (API endpoint `POST /v1/agents/register`, validation, in-memory storage).
    -   Messaging Interface Module (API endpoint `POST /v1/agents/{agentId}/run`, basic dispatching, error handling, external tool invocation).
    -   Tool Integration Module (Tool Interface ABC, updated Tool Registry supporting local classes and external endpoints).
-   **Phase 3: Integration & Interface Development:**
    -   Python SDK (`agentkit/sdk/`) providing client access to API endpoints.
    -   Basic CLI Tool (`agentkit/cli/`) for interacting with the service.
    -   Middleware for basic structured logging and error handling.
-   **Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Partial):**
    -   **Task 4.1:** Enhanced Unit Tests (>90% coverage achieved using `pytest-cov`).
    -   **Task 4.2:** Developed Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`) covering core workflows (registration, messaging, external tool invocation) using Docker Compose and a mock tool service.
-   **Initial Documentation:** Planning docs, `TASK.md`, `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, and Memory Bank structure established and updated.

## 2. What's Left to Build (High-Level Phases from TASK.md)

-   **Phase 4: Testing & Validation:** **(Current Focus)**
    -   Task 4.3: Refine CI/CD (testing, coverage, linting).
    -   Task 4.4: Basic Load Testing.
    -   Task 4.5: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) via examples.
-   **Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization:** All tasks pending (README updates, API docs review, sample projects finalization, etc.).
-   **Backlog / Future Enhancements:** All tasks pending (Async messaging, persistent storage, etc.).

## 3. Current Status

-   **Overall:** Phases 1-3 complete. Phase 4 (Testing & Validation) is in progress (Tasks 4.1, 4.2 complete).
-   **Code:** Core API, SDK, CLI implemented. Unit test coverage is high (>90%). Integration tests cover key workflows including external tool calls. Tool registry supports external endpoints.
-   **Infrastructure:** Docker setup includes API and mock tool service. Basic CI workflow exists but needs refinement (Task 4.3).
-   **Documentation:** Memory Bank is updated. `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` created. Core API documentation is auto-generated. README, examples, etc., need finalization (Phase 5).

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   **CI/CD:** Current CI pipeline needs enhancement to include integration tests and coverage reporting (Task 4.3).

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

-   Completed initial implementation phases (1-3).
-   Successfully enhanced unit test coverage (Task 4.1).
-   Refactored tool registry and messaging to support external HTTP tools, enabling more realistic integration tests (Task 4.2).
-   Implemented integration tests validating core workflows (Task 4.2).
-   Transitioned focus to refining the CI/CD pipeline (Task 4.3).

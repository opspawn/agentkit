# Progress: AgentKit Python Module (Initialization)

## 1. What Works / Completed

-   **Initial Planning:** `PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, and `AgentkitDevelopmentDoc.md` have been created, outlining the project scope, tasks, and technical details.
-   **Memory Bank Setup:** The core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated based on the initial planning documents.

## 2. What's Left to Build (High-Level Phases from TASK.md)

-   **Phase 1: Initialization & Research:** Most tasks are pending (Git setup, environment config, Docker setup, final tech stack decisions).
-   **Phase 2: Core Module Development & Refactoring:** All tasks pending (Agent Registration, Messaging Interface, Tool Integration modules).
-   **Phase 3: Integration & Interface Development:** All tasks pending (Python SDK, CLI tool, middleware).
-   **Phase 4: Testing & Validation:** All tasks pending (Unit tests, integration tests, CI setup, UAT).
-   **Phase 5: Documentation & Finalization:** All tasks pending (README updates, API docs, sample projects).
-   **Backlog / Future Enhancements:** All tasks pending (Async messaging, persistent storage, etc.).

## 3. Current Status

-   **Overall:** Project Initialization / Phase 0 complete. Ready to begin Phase 1 tasks.
-   **Code:** No functional code has been written yet.
-   **Infrastructure:** Basic file structure exists, but Git repo, Docker environment, and CI/CD pipelines are not yet set up.
-   **Documentation:** Initial planning docs and Memory Bank structure are in place. API documentation, detailed developer guides, and sample projects are pending.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   **Decision Required:** Flask vs. FastAPI needs to be finalized before starting API development (Task 2.1). (Leaning towards FastAPI as noted in `activeContext.md`).
-   **Dependencies:** Access to the main Opspawn repository might be needed for Git setup (Task 1.1).

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

-   *N/A* - Project is at the initial setup stage. Decisions recorded in `activeContext.md` are pending confirmation/implementation.
